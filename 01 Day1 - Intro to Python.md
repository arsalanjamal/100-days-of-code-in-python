# Day 1 - What is Programming and Python?

## What is Programming?

Programming is a way for us to tell computers what to do. A computer is a very dumb machine and it only does what we tell it to do. Hence, we learn programming and tell computers to do what we are very slow at - computation. 

If I ask you to calculate 5+6, you will immediately say 11. How about 23453453 X 56456?

You will start searching for a calculator or jump to a new tab to calculate the same. This 100 days of code series will help you learn Python from start to finish. We will start from 0, and by the time we end this course, I promise you will be a job-ready Python developer!

## What is Python?

Python is a dynamically typed, general-purpose programming language that supports an object-oriented programming approach as well as a functional programming approach.  
Python is an interpreted and a high-level programming language.  
It was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1989.

### Features of Python:
- Python is simple and easy to understand.
- It is interpreted and platform-independent, which makes debugging very easy.
- Python is an open-source programming language.
- Python provides very big library support. Some of the popular libraries include NumPy, TensorFlow, Selenium, OpenCV, etc.
- It is possible to integrate other programming languages within Python.

## What is Python used for?

- **Data Visualization**: Python is used to create plots and graphical representations.
- **Data Analytics**: Python helps in analyzing and understanding raw data for insights and trends.
- **AI and Machine Learning**: It is used to simulate human behavior and to learn from past data without hard coding.
- **Web Applications**: Python is used to create web applications.
- **Databases**: It can be used to handle databases.
- **Business and Accounting**: It is used to perform complex mathematical operations along with quantitative and qualitative analysis.
